This aliaslib distribution is configured to build on skink.  The makefiles
you are most likely to want to modify are Make.inc.skink and Make.version.
Make.inc.skink (or similar files for other machines) specifies search
paths and compiler options for the local machine.  Make.version specifies
the name of the machine include file, the spatial dimension, and the
discretization stencil.  The libraries are stored in subdirectories under
2d and 3d, so versions with different stencil choices or compiler options
can coexist.

I have added my graphics libraries as a subdirectory called graphtools.
To link the test programs you will either need to do a make in that
directory or, on skink, use /d/sa/nazgul/lib/libgraph.a.  Then set
LIBGRAPH appropriately in Make.inc.skink.

Include files Make.inc.rho and Make.inc.nersc are also provided.  You
will probably have to modify these to get paths right, but at least
they have compiler flags that work reasonably well.
